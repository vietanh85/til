### [20191712] yarn application stuck at NEW_SAVING state
* Version 3.1.1
* According to [this blog post](http://www.jadejaber.com/articles/yarn-application-submit-steps-and-status/), the issue may happen when the RM is trying to save the application to the state store.
* Take a look at the source code of the [ResourceManager.java](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-3.1.1-RC0/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/ResourceManager.java) I see this piece of code:
```java
  @Private
  private class RMFatalEventDispatcher implements EventHandler<RMFatalEvent> {
    @Override
    public void handle(RMFatalEvent event) {
      LOG.error("Received " + event);

      if (HAUtil.isHAEnabled(getConfig())) {
        // If we're in an HA config, the right answer is always to go into
        // standby.
        LOG.warn("Transitioning the resource manager to standby.");
        handleTransitionToStandByInNewThread();
      } else {
        // If we're stand-alone, we probably want to shut down, but the if and
        // how depends on the event.
        switch(event.getType()) {
        case STATE_STORE_FENCED:
          LOG.fatal("State store fenced even though the resource manager " +
              "is not configured for high availability. Shutting down this " +
              "resource manager to protect the integrity of the state store.");
          ExitUtil.terminate(1, event.getExplanation());
          break;
        case STATE_STORE_OP_FAILED:
          if (YarnConfiguration.shouldRMFailFast(getConfig())) {
            LOG.fatal("Shutting down the resource manager because a state " +
                "store operation failed, and the resource manager is " +
                "configured to fail fast. See the yarn.fail-fast and " +
                "yarn.resourcemanager.fail-fast properties.");
            ExitUtil.terminate(1, event.getExplanation());
          } else {
            LOG.warn("Ignoring state store operation failure because the " +
                "resource manager is not configured to fail fast. See the " +
                "yarn.fail-fast and yarn.resourcemanager.fail-fast " +
                "properties.");
          }
          break;
        default:
          LOG.fatal("Shutting down the resource manager.");
          ExitUtil.terminate(1, event.getExplanation());
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
* It mean that without HA and fail-fast enabled, yarn will ignore the error and our application will be stucked FOREVER at the NEW_SAVING state
* Recommendation: ALWAYS ENABLE HA FOR RM
